Introduction
Machine learning is starting to take over decision-making in many aspects of our
life, including:
(a) keeping us safe on our daily commute in self-driving cars
(b) making an accurate diagnosis based on our symptoms and medical history
(c) pricing and trading complex securities
(d) discovering new science, such as the genetic basis for various diseases.

Buffer Lists
A buffer list is a list of items that are stored temporarily to prevent them from
being lost or damaged. In machine learning, buffer lists are used to store and
process large amounts of data efficiently.*/

// Example: Buffer List for Data Preprocessing


struct BufferList
{
    string name;
    int capacity;
    int size;
    string[] data;

    this(string name, int capacity)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.size = 0;
        this.data = new string[capacity];
    }

    void add(string item)
    {
        if (size >= capacity)
        {
            throw new Exception("Buffer list is full");
        }
        data[size] = item;
        size++;
    }

    string[] getItems()
    {
        return data[0..size];
    }
}

// The main function A1 demonstrates the usage of the BufferList class.
// In this example, a buffer list named "pap -list name" is created with a capacity of

// But the startling truth is that these algorithms work without any sort of provable
// guarantees on their behavior. When they are faced with an optimization problem,
// do they actually find the best solution or even a pretty good one? When they posit
// a probabilistic model, can they incorporate new evidence and sample from the true
// posterior distribution? Machine learning works amazingly well in practice, but that
// doesnâ€™t mean we understand why it works so well.


// Conclusion
// In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve complex
// problems by learning from data. However, the world of machine learning is filled with
// uncertainty and challenges. By understanding the fundamental principles of machine learning
// and exploring the potential applications, we can make more informed decisions and
// continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.
// The future of machine learning is bright, filled with exciting opportunities and
// new challenges. As we continue to develop and refine machine learning algorithms, we can
